## Features

- 9 rows reflect each hour in a business day, 9am to 5pm. 

- The current day and date is rendered beneath the main header.

- Each row dynamically changes colors to reflect whether that given hour is in the    past, current, or in the future. Grey, red, and green, respectively.

- The edit button reveals three buttons, "Save", "Cancel", and "Clear".

- User inputs are saved in local storage, so the content persists upon refreshing the page.

- "Clear All" button empties local storage and refreshes the page.
