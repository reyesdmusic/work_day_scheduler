# work_day_scheduler

This application is a scheduler with one row for each business hour, from 9AM to 5PM. 

The user can click the "Edit" button on any given row to save a note in the text field for that hour. 

Because the content is saved in local storage, if the page is refreshed, the input data persists.

Each row will change colors to reflect whether or not the corresponding hour is current, past, or in the future: red, grey, and green, respectively.

A "Clear All" button allows the user to easily clear all the notes.
